#1 git rebase -i <Commit_ID>
#2 .gitignore













git rebase - <Commit_ID>

            --reword        Rename a commit message
            --drop          Delete a commit
            --squash        

            I think the golden rule is you should merge to master branch and rebase the feature branches
